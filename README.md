# Python Chess Project

This is a chess game project that I'm developing in Python. The aim of the project is to create a functional chess game that allows players to play against each other or against a computer. This project will also serve as a means to learn Python and demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub.

## Project Goals

- Implementation of chess rules
- Creation of a user interface
- Use of OOP principles and design patterns

## Technologies

- Python
- Pygame for graphical interface
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Features

- Fully interactive graphical user interface for playing chess.
- Support for turn-based gameplay between two players.
- Graphical display of the chessboard and various chess pieces.
- Implementation of all chess rules including different piece movements and capturing.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.0
- Pygame Library

### Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install Pygame using the command: `pip install pygame`

## How to Run

- Run the script to start the game: `python python_chess.py`
- Click on a chess piece to select it, and click on a valid square to move it.
- The game alternates turns between white and black pieces.

*More detailed instructions will be added later.*

## File Structure

- `python_chess.py`: Main game script.
- `images/`: Directory containing images of chess pieces.
