# Python Chess Project

This is a chess game project that I'm developing in Python. The aim of the project is to create a functional chess game that allows players to play against each other or against a computer. 
This project will also serve as a means to learn Python and demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub.

- Implementation of chess rules
- Creation of a user interface
- Development of AI opponent (optional)
- Use of OOP principles and design patterns

## Technologies
- Python
- Git and GitHub for version control
